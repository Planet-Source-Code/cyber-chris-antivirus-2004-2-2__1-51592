### Description

This is number two of my Anti Virus Program!

Now the software is able to detect every virus by scanning for checksums (again: Only the viruses wich are mentioned in the DB). The demo db includes the checksums of some popular Virii (e.g. Code Red, Klez, Magistrar + Eicar Testvirus). I have completeley over worked the Scaning algorithm. It is now able to scann 150MB (~7000 Files) within 35s. That means it is three times faster than my previous version! I have also totally changed the GUI: It has move-down menues like the Explorer has. Other new stuff: 1) There's also a function that scans a whole directory (and sub folders) for virii. 2) "Fast file search" function this is a manipulated cDialog that allows to scan the file without leaving the cDialog! 3) There's also a possibility to "secure" files. This is like a quarantaine function: It stores the file encrypted to prevent it from beeing executed!
